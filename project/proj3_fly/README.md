# Experiment #3 - Fly! Fly! Fly!

## Introduction

In this experiment, you are requiered to control a UAV to cross a forest in a plane.

## General Information

### Integrity

You can only write your control algorithms and commands in the simulation code and only control the specific motors on your robot. The code should be submitted along with the report. Do not try any methods to get higher scores in a dishonest way.

### Scoring

Automatic scoring is used in this experiment. Functions for automatic scoring is embedded in the given script. You can run your code and the script locally on your own computer and see the score for your control algorithm, but the final score is the average score for the results from our server. 
If large difference appears between the score from the server and your local results, please contact the T.A. and we can recheck the results.

### Grading

The final grade of one experiment depend both on the absolute score and the relative rank.
